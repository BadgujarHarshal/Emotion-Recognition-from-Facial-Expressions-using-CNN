# Emotion-Recognition-from-Facial-Expressions-using-CNN
Objective: 
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human facial expressions into 7 emotions: 
Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. 
Dataset Information: 
Name: FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition) 
Source: Kaggle 
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013 
Format: CSV file with 48x48 grayscale face images stored as pixel values, each labeled with one of the 
7 emotion categories. 
Tasks: 
Load and preprocess the dataset (convert pixel strings to images, normalize, split into train/val/test). 
Build a CNN using Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, etc.). 
Train the model and plot training/validation accuracy and loss. 
Evaluate the model on unseen test data using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report 
Display sample predictions with actual vs. predicted emotion labels.Tip: 
Start simple; then optionally try improving performance with techniques like Batch Normalization, 
Data Augmentation, or Transfer Learning.
